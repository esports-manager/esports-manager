        Initializes the event handler.
        The possible list represents all possible events in a match, which is composed of a tuple. Each value means:

        [0]: the event's conditions. This means that events with the same conditions are going to be included in the
        list of available events when certain conditions are met. For example: when the game time is above 0 minutes,
        the events: lane farm, gank, lane fight and team fight are unlocked. If an inhibitor is exposed, the
        inhibitor assault event is unlocked.
        [1]: name of the event.
        [2]: priority of the event. This is used by the random.choices as a weight. The higher the priority, the higher
        the chances to pick this event.
        [3]: number of points. Each event will award points to the team that gets on top of that, and sometimes,
        even awards points to individual players. These points will be added to the skill level of players and
        champions, making it more relevant in probability calculations.
