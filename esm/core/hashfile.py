class HashFile:
    """
    The Hash file is a file that stores data related to load and save games.

    It is used to make it more difficult to tamper with Save game files.
    Every time a game is saved, the filename is stored to the HashFile, which
    also stores the save file hash.

    When the game is loaded, the LoadGame module compares the loaded save file with
    the hash stored in the Hash file. If the hash is different, then the file might
    be corrupted or has been tampered with.

    The HashFile is a binary file, just like the save game files. It's an additional
    method to protect save game files, but may not be enough for that.
