# eSports Manager
eSports Manager is a free and open source esports management game,
based on titles like Football Manager and the deceased Championship Manager.
The idea here is to bring a full-fledged experience in eSports,
playing major leagues and big championships, managing players, setting
up practices and discovering new talents.

In this game, you can set up your team, get them to play in whatever  
position you would like them to, set up strategies, choose which race/
champion/hero they're going to play with, and read match descriptions as 
they happen live, much like Football Manager on its early days. Managing 
finances, finding sponsors, boosting your players' morale are also going to 
play a role in that experience.
