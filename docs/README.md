# eSports Manager Docs

This directory will hold the Documentation of the source code. In the future we will generate docs using Sphinx,
but as of now I'm going to use it to brainstorm ideas for some implementations and try to explain my thoughts.
I think this might be more useful than creating an entire Wiki for that purpose.
