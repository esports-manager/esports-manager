# eSports Manager Game Design Document

This document describes elements of the game that should be explored by developers. It is a document that provides the general ideas and abstractions that should compose the final product, and does not include implementation details and explanations of how the code actually works, or even actual in-game mock-ups.

## Introduction

At its core, **eSports Manager** is an interactive application created to abstract the concept of managing an eSport team. For such, it should contain elements that are related to the world of eSports competitions, and real-life references, such as:

- **The User**: This document will refer to the individual that uses this application as "The User", to avoid any confusions surrounding the term "player", which will be used to describe the eSports athletes.
- **Teams**
- **Players**
- **Match**
- **Competitions**
- **Finances**
- **Talent Discovery**: It is a way for managers to find new players and incorporate them to their team.

This application consists of a **User Interface** which provides tools for the User to interact with all the aspects of this abstraction.
