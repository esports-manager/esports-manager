    This function is used to find files used by the project. It receives the
    folder and searches from there. It removes the need to hard-code
    certain file paths.

    It was added because tests were failing outside of PyCharm, so running tests
    from terminal or VS Code was producing tons of errors. So I had to refactor
    everything, come up with ways that tests would work in all platforms, and that's
    what I ended up with.

    I hope this won't affect performance that much, and maybe in the future more
    elegant solutions will come out. I added the folder parameter to possibly
    prevent some performance issues that might arise with the expansion of this project.
    It's still unclear if it hits performance that much, but it's better safe than sorry.
